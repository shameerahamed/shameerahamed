### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shameer, a tech aficionado. In my spare time, I enjoy creating things that can automate boring routine works. If you don't see any recent github activity, then assume I'm busy designing a fantastic system for my current employer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my side projects such as Automated personal finance, Due Reminder and Work Clocking.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning iOS Swift, Flutter, Ionic, MongoDB and Python.
